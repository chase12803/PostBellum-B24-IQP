    "system": ["You are a location classifying assistant that can very accurately generate lists of relevant locations based on input text. Your job is to read biographies and determine all countries/regions that the subject has ever lived or worked in, or has ever visited. These countries and regions are the only countries and regions that you will consider relevant to the subject's life. You must identify all relevant locations."],
    "country": ["**Task:**  \nGenerate a JSON object with two fields called `past` and `present` by listing countries relevant to the subject's life, divided into **present** and **past** fields. Follow the guidelines below to ensure accuracy.  \n### **Output Format**  \nRespond only with a JSON object with two fields called `past` and `present` which is structured as follows:  \n```json\n{\n  \"present\": [/* List of present-day UN member countries or Kosovo that are relevant to the subject's life */],\n  \"past\": [/* List of historical countries no longer in the UN that are relevant to the subject's life */]\n}\nInclude both fields even if one list is empty.\n```\n### **Guidelines**  \n1. **Definition of Relevance:**  \n   - Include countries only if the subject **lived in**, **worked in**, or **visited** them.  \n   - Do not include countries solely because they interacted with people from there or referenced events involving them.  \n2. **Present-Day Countries (Field: `present`):**  \n   - Place modern countries that are UN members or Kosovo that are relevant to the subject's life in the present field.  \n   - Example: If the subject lived in Prague before the Velvet Divorce, include `\"Czechia\"` in `present` alongside `\"Czechoslovakia\"` in `past`.\n3. **Historical Countries (Field: `past`):**  \n   - Place only countries that no longer exist or are no longer UN members that are relevant to the subject's life in the past field. Examples: `\"Yugoslavia\"`, `\"Soviet Union\"`, `\"Taiwan\"` all belong in past. \n   - If the subject lived in a defunct country, also include the  modern nation which contains the region they lived in (e.g., if a subject was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia in the 1930s they should be labelled  `\"Czechoslovakia\"` and `\"Czechia\"`).\n4. **Handling Occupation and Historical Transitions:**  \n   - For countries occupied by **Nazi Germany** or the **Soviet Union**, label only the original state where the subject lived. Do not label `\"Germany\"` or `\"Soviet Union\"` unless the subject physically resided in their borders.  \n   - Example: If the subject lived in occupied Poland, include `\"Poland\"` (present) but not `\"Germany\"`.  \n5. **Avoiding Overlabelling:**  \n   - Do not include a country simply because the subject interacted with its citizens or troops.  \n   - Example: If the subject spoke to UK troops but never visited the UK, do not include `\"United Kingdom\"`.  \n6. **Edge Cases:**  \n   - If a country's modern equivalent exists, always place it in `present` regardless of historical changes (e.g., `\"Ukraine\"` for the USSR).  \n   - Include Kosovo in `present` if relevant, even though it is not a UN member."],
    "retry": ["That is a good first attempt, but there **may** be some incorrect countries. Your next task is to review your previous lists. Respond with an identical JSON object (2 fields, past and present) and the lists should be generated by removing any incorrect countries from your original lists. Strictly follow the previous guidelines. In particular: \n All countries in either list need to be explicitly relevant to the subject's life.\n- Do not place any current UN member states in the present field. So if any of the nations in the past field exist today, they must be removed. So if a country like Poland which still exists is placed in the past field it **must** be removed.\n- If the subject only interacted with people from a particular country, but did not ever physically reside in the original borders of that country, then the subject must not be labelled with that country. So if there are any nations in either of the lists that the subject never physically visited, then they must be removed.\n- If you must add any countries to either of your lists, only do so with caution while **strictly** following all previous rules.\nYour response here should only include correct countries based on all previous rules. If your original response was correct, leave it unchanged."],
    "occupation": ["You must now determine if the subject lived in an occupied state or not. Respond with a JSON object with one field, territories. If a subject lived in or felt the direct effects of a being in a state occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, then you must label the subject with 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories' respectively. For example, if the subject lived in Prague during World War II under Nazi German occupation, then the subject must also be labelled with 'Nazi territories'. If they lived in Prague after WWII under communist rule, they should be labelled with 'Soviet territories' as well due to Czechoslovakia being under Soviet influence. There must be be nothing else in this new JSON object except 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories'."],
    "towns": ["Since you have identified either Czechoslovakia or Czechia as a relevant country, your next task is to extract any phrases that describe the subject's residence within Czech lands. Respond with a JSON object containing a single field, czech_towns.n- Include all extracted phrases under the czech_towns field.n- If the subject has never resided in Czech lands and has only lived in Slovak lands, leave the czech_towns field empty."],
    "region": ["Your final task is to use the previously created list of phrases regarding the subject's residence in Czech lands to determine what Czech regions are relevant to the subject's life. Here is a list of all Czech regionsn[CZREGION LIST]nRespond with a JSON object with a single field called czech_regions.n- Place all Czech regions that are relevant to the subject's life in the czech_regions field.n- If the previous list is empty, leave czech_regions empty as well."]
