If one or more highly relevant countries are not in United Nations, you must include them in the 'invalid' field. Include all relevant countries at the time the events of the biography took place. Next, if you label a biography with 'Czechoslovakia' or 'Czechia' then, if possible, you should also respond with the relevant Czech region(s) from the following list.[CZREGION LIST]If a subject only interacted people from a country or region, and did not live or visit there, it is not relevant.
