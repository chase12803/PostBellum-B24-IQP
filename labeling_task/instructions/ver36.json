    "system": ["You are an AI location classifying tool that can very accurately generate lists of relevant locations based on input text. Your job is to read biographies and determine all countries/regions that the subject has ever lived or worked in, or has ever visited. These countries and regions are the only countries and regions that you will consider relevant to the subject's life. You must identify all relevant locations."],
    "country": ["You must respond with a list of past and present countries relevant to the subject's life. Do not respond with any other countries. Respond with a JSON object by classifying nations into present and past fields. Here are some strict guidelines you must follow to make this classification. \n- Determine all modern day nations which are relevant to the subject's life and are currently members of the United Nations. Place these nations in the present field. Once again this means they either lived in, worked in, or visited this country. The only non-UN country which can be placed in this field is Kosovo. \n- Determine all past nations which are relevant to the subject's life and are no longer a member of the United Nations. This includes nations that at one point were observer states in the UN like East and West Germany. Place nations that no longer exist or are no longer members of the United Nations in the past field. \n- Nations that exist today but have undergone historical changes (e.g., renaming, restructuring, or political transitions) must still be placed in present. For example, Poland, Ukraine, and Germany belong in present despite undergoing various transitions. \n Only defunct nations like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union or withdrawn members like Taiwan belong in the past field. \n- If you must label a past country that is no longer in the UN, you should also include the modern country which possesses the lands in which the subject lived. For example, if a subject was born in Prague before the Velvet Divorce, then the subject must be labelled both 'Czechoslovakia' and 'Czechia', even if they did not live or work in the current Czechia state.\n- If the subject lived in a state occupied by either Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, but never lived within their original borders, then you must not label the subject with Germany or Soviet Union, and you should only label them with the original state that was occupied.\n- If the subject only interacted with people from a particular country, but did not ever physically reside in the original borders of that country, then the subject must not be labelled with that country. For example, if a barracks near the subject's home housed Soviet troops, but they did not ever live in or visit the Soviet Union, then the subject must not be labelled Soviet Union.\n  - In addition to this previous rule do not consider the life of any of their individual family members or significant others. For example, if the subject's father was from Ukraine, but the subject never physically traveled there, then the biography must not be labelled Ukraine.\n- Use all available information to create your list. For example, if the biography not explicitly say that the subject lived in a particular country, but it does say that they lived in a city which is unique to any particular country, then the subject must be labelled with that country."],
    "retry": ["That is a good first attempt, but there **may** be some incorrect countries. Your next task is to review your previous lists. Respond with an identical JSON object (2 fields, past and present) and the lists should be generated by removing any incorrect countries from your original lists. Strictly follow the previous guidelines. In particular: \n All countries in either list need to be explicitly relevant to the subject's life.\n- Do not place any current UN member states in the present field. So if any of the nations in the past field exist today, they must be removed. So if a country like Poland which still exists is placed in the past field it **must** be removed.\n- If the subject only interacted with people from a particular country, but did not ever physically reside in the original borders of that country, then the subject must not be labelled with that country. So if there are any nations in either of the lists that the subject never physically visited, then they must be removed.\n- If you must add any countries to either of your lists, only do so with caution while **strictly** following all previous rules.\nYour response here should only include correct countries based on all previous rules. If your original response was correct, leave it unchanged."],
    "occupation": ["You must now determine if the subject lived in an occupied state or not. Respond with a JSON object with one field, territories. If a subject lived in or felt the direct effects of a being in a state occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, then you must also label the subject with 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories' respectively. For example, if the subject lived in Prague during World War II under Nazi German occupation, then the subject must also be labelled with 'Nazi territories'. If they lived in Prague after WWII under communist rule, they should be labelled with 'Soviet territories' as well due to Czechoslovakia being under Soviet influence."],
    "towns": ["Since you have identified either Czechoslovakia or Czechia as a relevant country, your next task is to extract any phrases that describe the subject's residence within Czech lands. Respond with a JSON object containing a single field, czech_towns.\n- Include all extracted phrases under the czech_towns field.\n- If the subject has never resided in Czech lands and has only lived in Slovak lands, leave the czech_towns field empty."],
    "region": ["Your final task is to use the previously created list of phrases regarding the subject's residence in Czech lands to determine what Czech regions are relevant to the subject's life. Here is a list of all Czech regions\n[CZREGION LIST]\nRespond with a JSON object with a single field called czech_regions.\n- Place all Czech regions that are relevant to the subjects life in the czech_regions field.\n- If the previous list is empty, leave czech_regions empty as well."]
