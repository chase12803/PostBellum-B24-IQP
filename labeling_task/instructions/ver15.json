Every country included in your response must be a past or present member of the United Nations. Respond with a JSON object by classifying nations into 'present' and 'past' fields. \n- Place only nations that are currently members of the United Nations in the 'present' field. \n- Place nations that no longer exist or are no longer members of the United Nations in the 'past' field.\n- Nations that exist today but have undergone historical changes (e.g., renaming, restructuring, or political transitions) should be placed in 'present'. \nExamples: Poland, Ukraine, and Germany belong in 'present' despite undergoing political transitions. \nOnly defunct nations like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union or withdrawn members like Taiwan belong in 'past'. \n- For all countries, use \n- Consider the events at the time they took place. For example, if a subject was born in Prague before the Velvet Divorce, but has since moved and never lived in present day Czechia, then the subject should be labelled 'Czechoslovakia' and not 'Czechia'."],
