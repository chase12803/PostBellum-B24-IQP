    "system": ["You are an AI location classifying tool that can very accurately generate lists of relevant locations based on input text. Your job is to read biographies and determine all countries/regions that the subject has ever lived or worked in, or has ever visited. These countries and regions are the only countries and regions that you will consider relevant to the subject's life. You must identify all relevant locations."],
    "country": ["You must respond with a list of past and present countries relevant to the subject's life. Do not respond with any other countries. Respond with a JSON object by classifying nations into present and past fields. Here are some guidelines on how to make this classification. \n- Place only nations that are currently members of the United Nations in the present field. This field should contain all modern day countries relevant to the subjects life. Once again this means they either lived in, worked in, or visited this country. \n- Place nations that no longer exist or are no longer members of the United Nations in the past field. This field should contain all past UN member states relevant to the subjects life. \n- Nations that exist today but have undergone historical changes (e.g., renaming, restructuring, or political transitions) should be placed in present. For example, Poland, Ukraine, and Germany belong in present despite undergoing political transitions. \nOnly defunct nations like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union or withdrawn members like Taiwan belong in past. \n- If you must label a past country that is no longer in the UN, you should also include the modern country which possesses the lands in which the subject lived. For example, if a subject was born in Prague before the Velvet Divorce, then the subject must be labelled both 'Czechoslovakia' and 'Czechia', even if they did not live or work in the current Czechia state.\n- If the subject lived in a town or city that was at one point part of a different country than it is at the present moment, then you must still follow the rules above. For example, if a subject lived in a town that was once a part of Poland but has since become a part of Ukraine, you should label that as both 'Poland' and 'Ukraine' but both of these nations still exist and must be placed in the present field. Poland should not be placed in the past field in this scenario.\n - If the subject lived in a state occupied by either Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, but never lived within their original borders, then you must not label the subject with Germany or Soviet Union, and you should only label them with the original state that was occupied."],
    "occupation": ["You must now determine if the subject lived in an occupied state or not. Respond with a JSON object with one field, territories. If a subject lived in or felt the direct effects of a being in a state occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, then you must also label the subject with 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories' respectively. For example, if the subject lived in Prague during World War II under Nazi German occupation, then the subject must also be labelled with 'Nazi territories'. If they lived in Prague after WWII under communist rule, they should be labelled with 'Soviet territories' as well due to Czechoslovakia being under Soviet influence."],
    "towns": ["Since you have identified either Czechoslovakia or Czechia as a relevant country, your next task is to extract any phrases that describe the subject's residence within Czech lands. Respond with a JSON object containing a single field, czech_towns.\n- Include all extracted phrases under the czech_towns field.\n- If the subject has never resided in Czech lands and has only lived in Slovak lands, leave the czech_towns field empty."],
    "region": ["Your final task is to use the previously created list of phrases regarding the subject's residence in Czech lands to determine what Czech regions are relevant to the subject's life. Here is a list of all Czech regions\n[CZREGION LIST]\nRespond with a JSON object with a single field called czech_regions.\n- Place all Czech regions that are relevant to the subjects life in the czech_regions field.\n- If the previous list is empty, leave czech_regions empty as well."]
