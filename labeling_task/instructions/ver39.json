    "system": ["You are an AI location classifying tool that can very accurately generate lists of relevant locations based on input text. Your job is to read biographies and determine all countries/regions that the subject has ever lived or worked in, or has ever visited. These countries and regions are the only countries and regions that you will consider relevant to the subject's life. You must identify all relevant locations."],
    "country": ["You must read the following biography and determine all countries relevant to the subject's life. You must respond with a JSON object containing two fields: `present` and `past`. Each field must only include lists of country names relevant to the subject's life, based on the following strict rules:\n### Classification Guidelines\n1. **Modern-Day Nations in the `present` Field**:\n- Identify all **currently existing UN member states** that are **relevant to the subject's life** and place them in the present field. These include:\n   - Nations they physically resided in, worked in, or visited during their lifetime.\n     - Include **Kosovo** if relevant, even though it is not a UN member.\n- Even if a nation underwent significant political or historical changes (e.g., reunification, renaming), it must still be listed in the `present` field under its modern name (e.g., \"Poland,\" not \"Second Polish Republic\").\n2. **Defunct or Withdrawn Nations in the `past` Field**:\n- Identify all nations that **no longer exist as UN members** (e.g., \"Yugoslavia,\" \"Czechoslovakia,\" \"Soviet Union,\" or \"East Germany\") that are **relevant to the subjects life** and place them in the past field.\n- If the subject lived in or interacted with a historical country, also include the modern nation(s) corresponding to the region they lived in.\n- **Example**: If the subject was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia in the 1930s then add both \"Czechoslovakia\" (past) and \"Czechia\" (present).\n3. **Occupied Territories**:\n    - If a subject lived in a state occupied by a past nation but not within the occupier's original borders, only list the occupied state. For example:\n- If a person lived in Estonia during Soviet occupation, list only \"Estonia\" (present), not \"Soviet Union\" (past).\n- Do not label the occupier unless the subject physically lived or worked within its original borders.\n4. **No Indirect Connections**:\n- Do not list countries the subject never visited, even if they interacted with its people or institutions. \n- Do not list countries the subject never visited, even if they interacted with their individual family members or significant other lived or visited there. \n- For example:      \n   - If Soviet troops were stationed near the subject's home but the subject never lived in or visited the Soviet Union, do not list \"Soviet Union.\"\n   - If a subject's father is from Poland, but the subject never lived in or visited Poland, do not list \"Poland.\"\n### Formatting Rules\n- Respond only with a JSON object with two fields structured as follows:\n  - ```json\n{\n  \"present\": [\"List of modern nations\"],\n  \"past\": [\"List of defunct nations\"]\n}\n```\n- Ensure no overlap between `present` and `past`.\n- Ensure the JSON object has both `present` and `past` fields even if one is empty.\n- Whatever you do, do not respond with a list of all UN member states. Respond with **ONLY** countries relevant to the subject's life.\n### Example Scenarios\n#### Example 1:\nA Subject Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia (1930s)\n```json\n{\n  \"present\": [\"Czechia\"],\n  \"past\": [\"Czechoslovakia\"]\n}\n```\n#### Example 2:\nA Subject Who Lived in Poland During WWII, Under Nazi Occupation\n```json\n{\n  \"present\": [\"Poland\"],\n  \"past\": []\n}\n```\n#### Example 3: \nA Subject Lived in Moscow Before the Soviet Union Dissolved\n```json\n{\n  \"present\": [\"Russia\"],\n  \"past\": [\"Soviet Union\"]\n}\n```"],
    "retry": ["That is a good first attempt, but there **may** be some incorrect countries. Your next task is to review your previous lists. Respond with an identical JSON object (2 fields, past and present) and the lists should be generated by removing any incorrect countries from your original lists. Strictly follow the previous guidelines. In particular: \n- All countries in either list need to be explicitly relevant to the subject's life.\n- Do not place any current UN member states in the past field. So if any of the nations in the past field exist today, they must be removed.\n- If the subject only interacted with people from a particular country, but did not ever physically reside in the original borders of that country, then the subject must not be labelled with that country. So if there are any nations in either of the lists that the subject never physically visited, then they must be removed.\n- The exact phrase \"Nazi Germany\" should not appear, use just \"Germany\" instead.\n- If you must add any countries to either of your lists, only do so while following all previous rules.\nYour response here should only include correct countries based on all previous rules. If your original response was correct, leave it unchanged."],
    "occupation": ["You must now determine if the subject lived in an occupied state or not. Respond with a JSON object with one field, territories. If a subject lived in or felt the direct effects of a being in a state occupied by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, then you must label the subject with 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories' respectively. For example, if the subject lived in Prague during World War II under Nazi German occupation, then the subject must also be labelled with 'Nazi territories'. If they lived in Prague after WWII under communist rule, they should be labelled with 'Soviet territories' as well due to Czechoslovakia being under Soviet influence. There must be be nothing else in this new JSON object except 'Nazi territories' or 'Soviet territories'."],
    "towns": ["Since you have identified either Czechoslovakia or Czechia as a relevant country, your next task is to extract any phrases that describe the subject's residence within Czech lands. Respond with a JSON object containing a single field, czech_towns.n- Include all extracted phrases under the czech_towns field.n- If the subject has never resided in Czech lands and has only lived in Slovak lands, leave the czech_towns field empty."],
    "region": ["Your final task is to use the previously created list of phrases regarding the subject's residence in Czech lands to determine what Czech regions are relevant to the subject's life. Here is a list of all Czech regions[CZREGION LIST]Respond with a JSON object with a single field called czech_regions.n- Place all Czech regions that are relevant to the subjects life in the czech_regions field.n- If the previous list is empty, leave czech_regions empty as well."]
