# PostBellum-B24-IQP
Public repository of scripts and files used during the completion of our Interactive Qualifying Project with our sponsor Post Bellum in B Term 2024.

Our project consisted of two main tasks.

1. Post Bellum's _Memory of Nations_ database is currently lacking the ability to search by geographic location. This is because entries in the database are missing such labels. We used Gemini 1.5 Pro to automatically label over 9000 of their database entries.

3. Post Bellum is planning on releasing an internation email newsletter within the next year, focusing mostly on general international collaboration and their interactive multimedia exhibitions called _Memory of Nations Institutes_. They currently only have reliable contacts in Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. To assist them, we compiled a list of contacts from all over the world which can be used to gauge interest in this future newsletter.
